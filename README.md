# Front-End Engineer Learning Roadmap

Welcome to the **Front-End Engineer Learning Roadmap**! üéâ

This roadmap is a structured, community-driven guide for front-end developers at any stage‚Äîwhether you're a **beginner** learning the basics, an **intermediate** developer honing your skills, or an **advanced** engineer looking to specialize.

### What Makes This Roadmap Unique?

Unlike other roadmaps, this one combines:

- **Clear, Simple Structure**: All resources are organized into one easy-to-read file.
- **Curated, High-Quality Resources**: Each topic includes trusted resources to help you learn effectively without the clutter.
- **Collaborative, Open-Source Approach**: This roadmap is community-driven, so it stays current and reflects what works best for real front-end developers.

### How It Works

We‚Äôve organized each major front-end topic‚Äîsuch as **HTML/CSS**, **JavaScript**, **React**, and more‚Äîinto three skill levels:

- **Beginner**: For those just starting out with foundational concepts.
- **Intermediate**: For developers ready to deepen their knowledge and refine their skills.
- **Advanced**: For front-end engineers who want to master complex topics and specialized areas.

Within each level, you‚Äôll find carefully selected courses, tutorials, and projects, so you know exactly where to start and how to level up.

### Get Involved!

This roadmap is open for contributions, so feel free to share your favorite resources or suggest improvements. Together, we‚Äôre creating a comprehensive, go-to resource for front-end developers everywhere!

## Contribution Guidelines

Want to contribute? Awesome! Please follow these guidelines:

1. **Add Trusted Resources**: Make sure the resources are high-quality and relevant to front-end development.
2. **Use Appropriate Levels**: Add resources to the Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced sections based on their difficulty.
3. **Provide a Short Description**: Include a one-line description of the resource to help users understand its focus.
4. **Format**: Follow the formatting used in the file for consistency.

### Review Process

All contributions are reviewed to ensure they align with the roadmap's standards and quality goals. After you submit a change, the team will review it and provide feedback or suggestions if needed. Approved changes will be added to the roadmap, and contributions that don‚Äôt quite fit may be politely declined or suggested for revision.

Together, we can make this roadmap a valuable resource for front-end developers everywhere!
